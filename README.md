# PlayerWaitingTimeQueue

This repository contains a project that focuses on calculating the waiting time of players waiting in a queue. Through the use of Monte Carlo Simulations, we are able to produce such events by utilizing random amount of players with different party sizes. Having the players arrive to a queue, we are checking to see the average wait time the players experience before they are added to a game.
